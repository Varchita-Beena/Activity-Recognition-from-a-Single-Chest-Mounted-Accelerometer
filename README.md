# Activity-Recognition-from-a-Single-Chest-Mounted-Accelerometer
Problem of predicting or classifying what a person is doing based on a trace of their movement using sensors.

Human Activity Recognition(HAR), is the problem of predicting what a person is doing based on a trace of their movement using sensors.<br/>
Movements are often normal indoor activities such as standing, sitting, jumping, and going up stairs. Sensors are often located on the subject such as a smartphone or vest and often record accelerometer data in three dimensions (x, y, z).<br/>
To classify the activities and predicting the activites on upcomimg motions.<br><br/>
##Dataset<br/>
It is freely available from the UCI Machine Learning repository under the name of <br/>
Activity Recognition from Single Chest-Mounted Accelerometer Data Set<br/>
The dataset collects data from a wearable accelerometer mounted on the chest. Uncalibrated Accelerometer Data are collected from 15 participants performing 7 activities. The dataset is intended for Activity Recognition research purposes. It provides challenges for identification and authentication of people using motion patterns.<br/><br/>
Dataset Information<br/>
Data are separated by participant<br/>
Each file contains the following information:<br/>
sequential number, x acceleration, y acceleration, z acceleration, label<br/>
Labels are codified by numbers<br/>
1: Working at Computer<br/>
2: Standing Up, Walking and Going up\down stairs<br/>
3: Standing<br/>
4: Walking<br/>
5: Going Up\Down Stairs<br/>
6: Walking and Talking with Someone<br/>
7: Talking while Standing<br/>
